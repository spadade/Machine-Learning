I have learn some fundamentals of machine learning as they can be applied to solve various business problems. Specifically, concentrated on classification modelling, segmentation and clustering, and recommendation systems.

Main objective that I have learnt in the Machine Leaning are:

- Think critically about how to use machine learning algorithms to solve a given business problem. 
- Know how to formulate business problems and identify relevant data to use in modeling frameworks.
- Know how to evaluate the appropriateness and estimate the performance of various machine learning models for a given task.
- Know how to use software tools (such as R) effectively to implement machine learning algorithms for data mining/visualization and analytics;
- Foster the communication and presentation of statistical results and inferences.

Some Projects included in the Repository are based on the below Machine Leaning concepts:

- Fundamental Concepts in Supervised Learning
- KNN Classification
- Na√Øve Bayes Classification 
- K-mean clustering algorithm
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Recommendation Systems
